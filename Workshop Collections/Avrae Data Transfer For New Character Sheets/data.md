Made a new sheet for your character and want to copy across everything that's stored by Avrae rather than importable from the sheet itself? Now you can!

All the functionality is in the subcommands.

Start with `!data export` and then follow the instructions it gives you.

IMPORTANT! Always double check you have selected the right characters for this, otherwise there is a possibility that cvars and counters for your other character might be overwritten!
