Imports all the custom counters, cvars, csettings, spells and attacks you exported. Remember to select the new version of the character before running this command.

Spells and attacks that are already present will not be imported.

The arguments you need will be provided when you export the character.

Add the following additional arguments to skip certain parts of the import process:
`nocc` - skips custom counters.
`nocvars` - skips cvars.
`noattacks` - skips attacks.
`nospells` - skips spells.
`nocsettings` - skips csettings.

After being imported, the exported data will be deleted from your uvars to tidy things up.
