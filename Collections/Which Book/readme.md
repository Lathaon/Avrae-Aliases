Easily check which sourcebooks you need for the spells your character knows. You can now also check sourcebooks for monsters, races/subraces and classes/subclasses!

Source code available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Lathaon/Avrae-Aliases).
I don't like coffee, but feel free to support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/lathaon).

**17th August 2022 Update:** Still keeping this up-to-date. Everything up to and including Spelljammer is supported. Small changes to how things will be displayed. Source code (including the gvars this uses) are now on my GitHub.

**7th Dec 2021 Update:** Strixhaven is now supported. I've also added a new alias, `!contents`, which is like an inverse of `!whichbook`, allowing you to search for a book title and see lists of content that book offers.

**5th Nov 2021 Update:** Just to confirm, everything up to and including Fizban's is supported. I've been keeping this up-to-date with the new books generally within a few days of release.

**17th Jan 2021 Update:** Fixed a bug where `!whichbook` would fail to show the help if you used an unrecognised subcommand.

**24th Dec 2020 Update:** Added `!whichbook races` and `!whichbook classes` and if you don't provide the necessary arguments, everything will now post help in the same channel rather than sending you a PM.

**4th Nov 2020 Update:** The SRD removes reference to the named characters some spells are credited to. `!whichbook spells`  now lists these spells in a separate section. Support has been pre-emptively added for spells in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything. Additionally, `!whichbook monsters` has been added!

**Note:** It's possible to match so many monsters or spells that you'll get an error. At some point, I might allow for multiple "pages" of results to fix this, but for now you'll just have to be a bit more specific with your search terms!
