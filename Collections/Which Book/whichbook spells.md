Tells you which books you can find spells in.

**Without Arguments**
If used without arguments, the alias will look at your character's known spells and show which book each spell is from. Any custom spells you set up for the `!prep` alias (by Derixyleth#0636) will be recognized as homebrew. Spells from Unearthed Arcana and 3rd party supplements will show as unrecognized, as these are not supported.

**With Arguments**
If you include arguments, it'll show all the spells from official material that matched one or more of your arguments, and which books you can find them in.
