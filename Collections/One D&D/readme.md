Aliases and resources to help with [One D&D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/one-dnd) playtesting.
​
Here's [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ooi2Kpl1NbGRBgKp6wG18c8RAstUVuW3BgHddFnM3Sw/edit?usp=sharing) of all official spells so you can see which classes gained or lost which spells.
There are filter views for different classes, etc.
Classes that haven't made it to 1D&D yet will just show their 5e lists as I don't want to make assumptions about what schools they'll get access to.
I have interpreted spells from outside the PHB as still being accessible to all the classes they say they are in their respective books.
Thanks to Croebh#5603 for helping provide some of the data for this!
