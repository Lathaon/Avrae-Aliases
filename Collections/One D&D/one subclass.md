One D&D Subclasses lookup. Search for a Subclass using the first argument. You can also specify a Class level as the second argument to view all the benefits you would get from the Class at that level if using this Subclass.

Note that using a second argument to specify 1st level (e.g. `!one class champion 1`) will show the benefits if you multiclass into the base class. For starting characters, don't specify a level!

Using without arguments will display a list of the Subclasses which are supported.
