Now you can specify your character's pronouns!

My hope is that by publishing this collection, it will enable other alias developers to easily and consistently have their aliases refer to characters by their specific pronouns rather than always using gender-neutral terms regardless of the character.

Pronouns are saved to the cvars `ungendered`, `they`, `them`, `their` and `theirs`. This means you can effectively load the character's pronouns even outside of Draconic. See below for an example:

`!test <name> (<they>/<them>) can now be referred to using <their> correct pronouns! Victory is <theirs>!`

If you find any issues or would like to request additional variables or features, please feel free to ping me on the Avrae Development Discord server.
