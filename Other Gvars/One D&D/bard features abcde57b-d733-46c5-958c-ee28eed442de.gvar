  title: "Bard 1st Level: Spellcasting"
  desc: "You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. [See the _Player's Handbook_ for the rules on spellcasting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting). The information below details how you use those rules as a Bard."
  fields:
  - title: Chosen Spell List
    body: "At 1st level, choose a spell list: Arcane, Divine, or Primal. The chosen list is your Bard spell list and represents the magical tradition in which you learned your bardic arts. Whichever list you choose, it includes the _Vicious Mockery_ cantrip for you."
  - title: Cantrips
    body: "You know two cantrips of your choice from your Bard spell list.\n\nWhenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from your Bard spell list.\n\nWhen you reach 4th and 10th level in this class, you learn another cantrip of your choice from your Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard table."
  - title: Spell Slots
    body: "The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest."
  - title: Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level
    body: "You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four 1st-level spells from your Bard spell list.\n\nThe number of spells on your list also increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from your Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a 3rd-level Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.\n\nIf another Bard feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature."
