"Cleric: Channel Divinity":
  title: "Cleric: Channel Divinity (1st Level)"
  desc: "You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create, and you gain additional effect options at higher levels in this Class.\n\nYou can use your Channel Divinity a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require Saving Throws. When you use such an effect from this Class, the DC equals the Spell Save DC from this Class's Spellcasting feature."
  fields:
  - title: "Channel Divinity: Divine Spark"
    body: "As a Magic Action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at them. Roll a number of d8s equal to your Proficiency Bonus and add the rolls together. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Radiant Damage equal to the total, and on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (rounded down)."
  - title: "Channel Divinity: Turn Undead"
    body: "As a Magic Action, you present your Holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring Undead creatures. Each Undead within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom Saving Throw. If the creature fails its Saving Throw, it is Dazed for 1 minute or until it takes any damage or you are Incapacitated or die. While Dazed in this way, the only Action the creature can take is the Dash Action, and if it Moves, it must end that Move farther from you than where it started."

For example, as a 4th-level Cleric, you can prepare four different 0-level Spells, four different 1st-level Spells, and three different 2nd-level Spells.\n\nConsult the “Prepared Cleric Spells” section for recommendations on which spells to prepare at higher levels."
