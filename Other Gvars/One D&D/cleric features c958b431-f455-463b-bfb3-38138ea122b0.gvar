"Cleric: Divine Order":
  title: "Cleric 1st Level: Divine Order"
  desc: "You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice:\n\n**Protector**. Trained for battle, you gain Martial Weapon proficiency and Heavy Armor training.\n\n**Thaumaturge**. You know one extra cantrip from the Divine spell list (see your Spellcasting feature for information on preparing spells). In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1)."

"Cleric: Spellcasting":
  title: "Cleric 1st Level: Spellcasting"
  desc: "You have learned to cast spells through prayer, meditation, and devotion. [See the _Player's Handbook_ for the rules on spellcasting](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/spellcasting). The information below details how you use those rules as a Cleric."
  fields:
  - title: Cantrips
    body: "You know three cantrips of your choice from the Divine spell list. Rather than choosing, you may start with _Guidance_, _Sacred Flame_, and _Thaumaturgy_.\n\nWhenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Divine spell list.\n\nWhen you reach 4th and 10th level in this class, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Divine spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric table."
  - title: Spell Slots
    body: "The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest."
  - title: Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level
    body: "You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four 1st-level spells from the Divine spell list. Rather than choosing, you may start with _Bless_, _Cure Wounds_, _Guiding Bolt_, and _Shield of Faith_.\n\nThe number of spells on your list also increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Divine spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a 3rd-level Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.\n\nIf another Cleric feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature."
  - title: Changing Your Prepared Spells
    body: "Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing one or more of the spells there with other Divine spells for which you have spell slots. Preparing a new list requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell you add to the list."
  - title: Spellcasting Ability
    body: "Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Cleric spells."
  - title: Spellcasting Focus
