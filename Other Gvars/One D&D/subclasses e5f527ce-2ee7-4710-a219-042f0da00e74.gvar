  fields:
  - title: "3rd Level: Frenzy"
    body: "You can go into a frenzy in battle. If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack.

On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. If you've run out of uses of this feature, you can expend a use of your Rage, choosing not to activate the Rage and activating Intimidating Presence instead."

You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its supernatural origin.\n\nIn combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a Bonus Action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n\nIf the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.\n\nWhenever you finish a Long Rest, you can summon a different primal beast. The new beast appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, it vanishes when the new beast appears. The beast vanishes if you die."

  - title: "6th Level: Dark One's Own Luck"
    body: "You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest."
  - title: "10th Level: Fiendish Resilience"

    body: "When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.\n\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a Fiend, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save Dc upon its return. On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 Psychic damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Spell Slot of at least 4th level when you use it again. You can use this feature only once per turn."

"Wizard: Evoker":
  desc: "You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as adventurers."

  - title: "3rd Level: Evocation Savant"
    body: "Choose two Evocation spells from the Arcane spell list, each of which must be no higher than 2nd level. You add those spells to your spellbook without needing to cast Scribe Spell.\n\nIn addition, whenever you cast *Scribe Spell* to add a spell to your spellbook, the gold cost and casting time you must spend to add an Evocation spell to your spellbook is halved."
  - title: "3rd Level: Sculpt Spells"
    body: "You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save."
  - title: "6th Level: Potent Cantrip"
    body: "Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip."
  - title: "10th Level: Empowered Evocation"

    body: "You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast an Arcane or a Wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\n\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity."
