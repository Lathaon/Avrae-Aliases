"Sorcerer: Spellcasting":
  title: "Sorcerer: Spellcasting (1st Level)"
  desc: "Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See the [Player's Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Sorcerer."
  fields:
  - title: "Cantrips"
    body: "You know four cantrips of your choice from the Arcane spell list. Rather than choosing, you may start with *Light*, *Message*, *Prestidigitation*, and *Shocking Grasp*.\n\nWhenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another Arcane cantrip of your choice.\n\nWhen you reach 4th and 10th level in this class, you learn another Arcane cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer table."
  - title: "Spell Slots"
    body: "The Sorcerer table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest."
  - title: "Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level"
    body: "You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two 1st-level spells from the Arcane spell list. Rather than choosing, you may start with *Burning Hands* and *Detect Magic*.\n\nThe number of spells on your list also increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Arcane spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. For example, if you're a 3rd-level Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Arcane spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.\n\nIf another Sorcerer feature, such as Innate Sorcery, gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature."
