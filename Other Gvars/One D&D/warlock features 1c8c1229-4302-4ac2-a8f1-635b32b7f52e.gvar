Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Arcane spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. For example, if you're a 5th-level Warlock, your list of prepared spells can include six Arcane spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.\n\nIf another Warlock feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature."

"Fiend Patron: Hurl through Hell":
  title: "Fiend Patron: Hurl through Hell (14th Level)"
  desc: "When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.\n\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a Fiend, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save Dc upon its return. On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 Psychic damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Spell Slot of at least 4th level when you use it again. You can use this feature only once per turn."
